# Cloud-Based Bus Pass System – CodeAlpha Internship (Task 3)

This project is my submission for **Task 3** of the CodeAlpha Internship:  
**Cloud-Based Bus Pass System**

---

Project Overview

This system generates cloud-based bus passes using Python.  
It allows users to enter details such as:

- Name  
- Age  
- Bus Route  
- Pass Duration  
- ID Number  

And automatically produces a digital bus pass in **HTML format**, which can be stored or viewed online.


Features

Cloud-Ready Digital Pass
Outputs a clean HTML bus pass easily hosted or served online.

Prevents Duplicate Passes  
Uses unique ID numbers to avoid duplication.

Validates User Input  
Ensures all details are correctly filled before generating a pass.

Lightweight & Simple  
Runs on any low-spec device (mobile-friendly).
